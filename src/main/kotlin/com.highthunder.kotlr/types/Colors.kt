/**
 * Colors - Image blocks may contain a color field which provides the dominant colors stored for the image in the Post
 * metadata. The value is an object with string fields where the key starts with a c and ends with a number, eg.
 * c0, c1, c9. The values are a string of three or six characters representing an RGB hex value. These values are
 * typically used for creating a placeholder gradient while images are loading. The colors represented for an image
 * are the same for every size of that image.
